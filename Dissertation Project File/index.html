                            <h2>Why now?</h2>
                            <p>This reports is about 'The Unemployment Problem of South Korean Young People and the Effects of Their Lack of Political Participation'. There is a demonstrable need for contemporaneous data-driven investigative reporting which aims to illuminate contributive factors to democratic disenfranchisement amongst South Korean young people. The aim of this article is to do that with stories and visualised data. Regional and national governments of South Korea promised reform in the face of increasing demand for economic intervention on behalf of the youth of the country as a response to longstanding concerns about unemployment, poverty and poor housing provision. However, the reality is that not much has changed - but why? Many experts point out that the lack of youth participation in the political process have effectively silenced their voices in the policy-making processes. The youth of South Korea must overcome a harsh reality and make their voices heard effectively â€“ democratic franchise is a priority.</p>
