                <h2>New rules for a new generation</h2>
                <p>In September 2015, Seongnam, a city in the Gyeonggi province implemented a 'Youth Dividend Policy' – the policy is a form of universal basic income – the first of its kind in South Korea. This policy provides residents at 24 years old with 500,000 Won per year. According to the <a href="https://www.seongnam.go.kr/city/1000060/30005/bbsView.do?idx=134022">Seongnam City Government</a>, the idea of the policy is to support young people while they apply for jobs after graduating university. The policy means they receive direct support from the government but this support can only be used at the traditional markets and small local shops thus minimising capital flight out of the region.</p>
                <p>The <a href="http://news.seoul.go.kr/gov/archives/503902">Seoul Metropolitan Government</a> followed suit, with a 'Youth Allowance Policy' in June 2017. 5,000 of the unemployed young people aged 19 to 34 have been paid 500,000 Won monthly for six months. of those 5,000 the majority live on less than 150% of median income during the year.</p>
                <p>However criticism against the dividend is persistent – often pointing out that those policies are populist, and lead to moral decline amongst young people. It is pointed by <a href="http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201511122258425">Liberty Korea Party</a> out that the budget should be focused on the fundamentals of economic orthodoxy. They advocate pivoting from social support to preparing for the fourth industrial revolution or expanding the labour market. These concerns make it politically difficult to expand youth support policies. </p>
                <p><a href="http://likms.assembly.go.kr/bill/billDetail.do?billId=PRC_L1H7S0K4Z1K3C1I1C4O2D5T7N8V3B5">Youth Welfare Act</a>, initiated by the <a href="http://theminjoo.kr/main.do">Democratic Party</a> in the early 2017 to provide a legal basis for the youth support, has not yet passed the National Assembly. The bill defines youth as 19 to 34 year-olds, and entails establishing an official Youth Committee. The committee’s remit includes planning major youth policies every five years, and is charged with increasing youth participation in the policy-making processes. If the bill passes, it would represent the first time Korean young people would potentially receive fiscal support for employment, housing, and poverty through long-term policymaking.</p>

                <p>The bills progress, however, has been slow to progress through the Korean Parliament. The Korean legislature has spent the 2 years procrastinating holding a debate on the bill due to “numerous social issues”. Park Jumin, congressman of <a href="http://theminjoo.kr/main.do">Democratic Party</a>, who proposed the bill is bewildered by the inaction of his colleagues "This bill is one of the most urgent bills that we need to pass as soon as possible. We should not neglect young people's demand anymore."</p>
                <p>This bill modelled on the policies of Austria. Accordint to the <a href="https://www.zsi.at/en/object/partner/2307">Federal Ministry of Economy, Family and Youth of Austria</a>, the Austrian government implements youth policies on the basis of the 'Federal Youth Promotion Act' and 'Federal Youth Representation Act' amongst others. The 'Austrian National Youth Council' acts as a representative body of young people across the country. Through this system, Austrian youths can actively participate in various decision-making processes related to them. "There should be an institutional window for young people to speak up. It is urgent to pass the bill because it is already too late." said Park. </p>
