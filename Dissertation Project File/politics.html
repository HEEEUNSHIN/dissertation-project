                <h2>an old man’s game</h2>
                <p>South Korea is one of the oldest societies with a rapidly aging population. According to the <a href="http://elecinfo.nec.go.kr/neweps/00/00/elec.do?selects=1&keyWord=%C1%A617%B4%EB+%B4%EB%C5%EB%B7%C9+%BC%B1%B0%C5+%C5%F5%C7%A5%C0%B2+%BA%D0%BC%AE">Election Information Library of National Election Commission</a>, almost a quarter of all voters (24.4%) are over 60. Comparatively 20 to 29 comprise a mere 15.9% of total voters. Young people between 19 to 39 years old are 35.1% of the total. South Korea is the only OECD country that does not give the right to vote to 18 years old. The elderly in their 40s(20.6%) and 50s(20%) make up the majority of voters.</p>
                <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/624624"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
                <p>For the last five presidential elections since 1997, citizens aged 40 and older had high participation rates in the vote. Comparatively young people's voting rates have stagnated  below the average. Analysis of the voting rates between the 15th to 19th presidential elections, has revealed that the youth voting rate consistently failed to meet the average rate. In every election, youth voting rate was well below the average. The 2017 election, in which current president Moon Jae-in was elected, saw this change – however we must take into consideration the extreme circumstances of the Choi Soon-sil scandal. The scandal galvanised the youth vote due to impeachment of former president Park Geun-hye. This interest in the early presidential election was high compared with previous elections for the all age group, and so not reflective of the longer trend.</p>
                <p>Experts pointed out that the youth's political apathy is directly linked to their experiences. Kim Hyosun, activist of the <a href="http://www.peoplepower21.org">People's Solidarity for participatory Democracy</a> said, "Young people are suffering from unemployment and lose their attention in politics, and their indifference creates a vicious cycle of losing their chances to represent young people in politics."</p>

                <p>This political apathy amongst young south Koreans has also lead to Korea's National Assembly rapidly getting older. According to the <a href="http://info.nec.go.kr">National Election Commission</a>, there is only one congressman in the 20s of the 300 elected in the last 20th election. Congressmen in the 30s were also just 2, lower than 5 of 70s. The number of congressmen in their 20 to 30s were 7 in the 18th election and 9 in the 19th election. However this number has reduced to 3 in the 20th election. On the other hand, the average age of the congressmen has gone up from 51 years old in the 17th election to 55.5 years old in the 20th recent election. </p>
                <p>Ahn Juyeop, senior researcher of <a href="https://www.kli.re.kr/kli/index.do">Korea Labor Institute</a> stresses "The lack of voice of the 20s and 30s in the society is because less than 1% of congressmen can represent young people with 35.1% of all the voters. This is related to the fact that the youth in South Korea is the least supported group after children, the elderly, the disabled, and low-income people." Ahn Hyeyoung, member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theminjoo2017">National Young Committee of Democratic Party of Korea</a> said, "Young people's poor political participation is deeply related to the reality that youth policies are disregarded in the parliament. That's why our first goal to achieve is to encourage young people to vote for the election and particiapte in politics in various ways."</p>
                <p>However, many obstacles discourage young people from taking part in politics in South Korea. <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/358/0000006365">Korean Law</a> requires legislators are at least 25 years when running for Elction. The president election also has a minimum age requirement - 40 years old. This arbitrary rule is absurd when taken within the context of international politics. French president Emmanuel Macron started his presidency at his 39 and New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern took office at 37 years old. Many developed countries including Canada and Germany allow 18 to 19 year-old youth to run as members of parliament. </p>
                <p>Another barrier to entry is the high cost associated with <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/277/0004517892">participating as a candidate a political campaign</a> in South Korea. To run in the general election, a candidate will need to pay a 20 million won deposit (roughly $16,743 US). If the candidate fails to get at least fifteen percent of the votes, they lose this deposit. Ahn Hyeyoung say it best "reforming old systems preventing young people's political participation should be followed as soon as possible. Solving youth problem including unemployment and poverty is all related to amending the old system."</p>
