                <p>According to <a href="http://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?orgId=101&tblId=DT_1PB1607&conn_path=I2">Korean Statistical Information Service</a> (As of 2017) the number of young people aged 20 to 34 are 6.97 million nationwide, of which 1.5 million live in Seoul. Almost one in five of all Korean youths live in Seoul. Including the Seoul metropolitan area, almost half of total youth population(48%) live here for searching their jobs.</p>
                <h2 class="content-subhead">Number of Employment</h2>
                <p>20 to 34 year-old Youth Employment(thousand) has dradually decreased since 2008.</p>

                <p>The KOSIS data above shows that the youth employment situation has been deteriorating for a long time. The number of those employed between the ages of 20 to 34 per year peaked at 673.3 million in 2008. However, since the global economic crash this number has decreased over the last ten years to 621.1 million. The last decade has seen South Korea loss 52.2 million of job places.</p>
                <p>The number of youth employment is closely related to the economic fluctuation. South Korea, like most first world economies, experienced a recession after global financial crisis triggered by US subprime mortgage insolvency in 2008. According to Jo Youngmoo, researcher of <a href="http://www.lgeri.com/index.do">LG Economic Research Institute</a>, despite the fact that by the economy had almost overcome the recession in 2010, overall economic viability has dropped significantly. The South Korean economy entered a low growth phase in 2014, which has seen the number of youth employment start to decrease rapidly.</p>
                <p>Some Economists such as Choi Bae-Guen, professor of Economics, <a href="http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/do/Index.do">Konkuk University</a>, point out that low-term low growth of South Korea is one of the structural causes of youth unemployment. "It is clear that the job deterioration for the youth is not temporary, but structural and fixed. The crisis in manufacturing which is South a Korea's major industry, such as shipbuilding and automobiles, has led to the reduction in employment of large corporations, accelerating youth unemployment."</p>
                <h2 class="content-subhead">Youth Unemployment Rate</h2>
                <p>Youth Unemployment rate has notably gone up since 2008.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The worsening employment environment is effectively demonstrated by employment rates.  According to KOSIS, the unemployment rate for South Korean youth amongst young people aged 20 to 29 has significantly worsened compared with that of 30 to 34 year-olds for the past ten years. Since 2015 the unemployment rate has risen significantly, particularly for both 20 to 29, and 30 to 34 year-olds.</p>
                <p>However, even the KOSIS concedes that the unemployment rate indicator still does not reflect the full picture - because unemployment rate classifies part-time job youth as employed and does not take into account the economically inactive. Kim Moonsuk, spokesman of KOSIS said "There are a lot of young people applying for full-time jobs while working part-time, so there is a weak point for current unemployment rate to show all the reality of the job market." </p>
                <h2 class="content-subhead">Reality, a lot worse than the data</h2>
                <p>Over 22% of young people(15 to 29) are suffering from unemployment in 2018.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx;ILOSTATCOOKIE=A7rJExTQx9rcUW63Zxall3cubXWpFaRzsJ7gXqqdkm8Jpua7T9J6!-612270756?MBI_ID=2&locale=en&_afrLoop=3453028878077646&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%2Foracle%2Fwebcenter%2Fportalapp%2Fpages%2Fstatistics%2FilostatHome.jspx%40%3F_adf.ctrl-state%3Ddfo1l24ei_4">International Labour Organisation</a> suggests the 'Labour Underutilisation' indicators that provide more accurate assessment of unemployment in South Korea. The ILO announced a new internationally recognised methodology concerning labour underutilisations to overcome the limitations of existing data. 'Underutilisation 3' in the chart above includes those who are able to find work potentially and 'Underutilisation 4' counts part-time job holders, potential job seekers, and students who are preparing for the jobs.</p>
                <p>Labour Underutilisation 4 shows that over one out of five youth is struggling to get stable work in 2018. It is conceivable that the unemployment of young people in South Korea is actually far worse. "Efforts to reinvigorate the economy are important, but it takes much time. Job places are not easily created unless the industrial structure changes. More important thing right now is to pay attention to youth unemployment issue and to strengthen supports and social safety nets for the unemployed." adds Professor Choi Bae-Guen.
